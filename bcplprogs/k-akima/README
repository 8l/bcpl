This directory contains three fun BCPL programs kindly submitted by
Kiyoshi Akima. One will calculate Pi to many decimal places, one in a
poor man's grep program and the last faithfully emulates both the
three- and four-rotor Enigma cipher machines. There is PDF
documantation of each program.

I have made some minor layout edits to his BCPL programs.
