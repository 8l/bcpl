All macro programs with filenames ending in .bgpm can be run using
bgpm, and those ending in .gpm should be run using gpmcj or gpm. gpm
is like gpmcj but with minor corrections concerning the treatment of
DEF and UPDATE.

To demostrate the problem try

gpmcj prime.gpm

and 

gpm.prime.gpm

There are some notes about the implementations of gpm and bgpm in
bgpm.txt and gpm.txt.

Various macro programs woth trying are:

bgpm versions

bug.bgpm      defs.bgpm    hanoi.bgpm  prime.bgpm  sumbug.bgpm	updtst.bgpm
collatz.bgpm  errors.bgpm  perm.bgpm   sum.bgpm    t1.bgpm

gpm versions

bug.gpm      defs.gpm	 hanoi.gpm  prime.gpm	sum.gpm  updtst.gpm
collatz.gpm  errors.gpm  perm.gpm   sumbug.gpm	t1.gpm
