This is to demonstrate that GPM and BGPM macros can leave definitions
behind.

[DEF\defs\{
Defining ^1a`
[DEF\^1a\{Macro ^0 called with argument ^1}]
Defining ^1b`
[DEF\^1b\{Macro ^0 called with argument ^1}]
Defining ^1c`
[DEF\^1c\{Macro ^0 called with argument ^1}]
}]`

{[defs\A]} => [defs\A]
{[defs\B]} => [defs\B]
{[defs\C]} => [defs\C]

{[Aa\xxx]} => [Aa\xxx]
{[Bb\yyy]} => [Bb\yyy]
{[Cc\zzz]} => [Cc\zzz]

End of test
