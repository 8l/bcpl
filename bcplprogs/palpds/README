This directory contains files relating to an early version of PAL
preserved by Ed Feustal as the dump of an IBM 370 Partitioned Data
Set.

The aim is to systematically edit these files so that they can run
under the current version of Cintcode BCPL. This will involve
stylistic changes, reformatting, and slight modifications to BCPL to
deal with features not in the current version of Cintcode BCPL. These
include <> the more binding version of semicolon (;) and implementaion
of floating point (but probably not manifest floating point constants.

The current idea is that floating point numbers have a mantissa of 8
decimal digits and a signed integer exponent. The compiler will not
know the hardware representation of floating point values.

The main utilities used to help this transformation will be a new
version of casech to change the case of reserved words and
identifiers, cvbcpl to deal with section brackets and string and
format characters, and indentbcpl to layout the programs in a
consistent fashion.
