This directory is used for the development of MC Packages.
Currently only mci386 is under development.

The Makefile can be used to compile it, generate a cross reference
listing and install mci386.b and mc.h in the appropriate BCPL
distribution directories (BCPL/cintcode/com and BCPL/cintcode/g).

The files in this directory are:

mc.h             The testing version of the MC header file
mci386.b         The testing version of the mci386 package
mctest.b         A test program for the mci386 package
mcver.b          A systematic test for the mci386 package
xrefdata         A cross reference listing for mci386.b

Further documentation can be found in bcplprogs/mc/doc/.
