sialsep 

This separates an sial stream into 11 separate files:

Cstr, Fstr, Gstr, Kstr, Lstr, Mstr, Nstr, Pstr, Rstr, Tstr and Wstr.

These each contain the sequence of numbers for each type of value in
in the sial source stream. The type letters are omitted. For example, if
the sial data starts as follows:

F104
F103
K3
C83
C89
C78
F113
K5
C115
C116
C97
C114
C116
F111
L1
F11
K0
F13

The Cstr starts as follows:

83
89
78
115
116
97
114
116

and Kstr starts as follows:

3
5
0

These stream are compressed by compression programs specifically designed
for each type of stream. For example, Kstr is compressed by the program
ksquash.b. The command

ksquash

will compress Kstr and print out the size of the resulting file.
