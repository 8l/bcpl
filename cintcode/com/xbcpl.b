// This will be a version of the BCPL to Cintcode compiler with
// some extensions to handle non standard BCPL extensions such
// as the <> operator and floating point.

// Implemented by Martin Richards (c) July 2010

// Note: ../cintcode/ is used so that the compiler can be
// compiled in a directory parallel to cintcode (such as natbcpl).
