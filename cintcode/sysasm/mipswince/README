BCPL Cintcode for Windows CE 2.0


The files in this directory can be used to build the BCPL Cintcode
system for Windows CE 2.0. They have be tested on an HP 620LX handheld
machine.

To use them you need to have installed Windows CE Services and have an
HP620LX running Windows 2.0. If you wish to recompile the system you
will also need Visual C 5.0 and the Windows CE Toolkit.

After possibly editing Makefile, just type:

nmake

This will rebuild ceBCPL.exe and copy it to the handheld machine.

You will need to copy the directories bcpl\cintcode and bcpl\bcplprogs
into the handheld machine. Note that the HP620LX is a little ended
machine and so little ended versions of the Cintcode files are needed.
These are exactly the same as the Linux or Windows versions and so
no special action is necessary.

Next, update some windows CE Registry entries as described at the end
of this document.

Double clicking the ceBCPL icon will start the BCPL Cintcode system.
When using it for the first time it is a good idea to recompile the
system by executing the following two commands:

prefix bcpl/cintcode
c compall

To try out some of the demonstration programs in bcpl/bcplprogs type:

prefix bcpl/bcplprogs/demos
c b primes
primes
c b queens
queens

prefix bcpl/bcplprogs/graphics
c b gr
gr

This last example demonstrated a very simple graphics package that
allows a BCPL program to draw lines and points in 8-bit colour.

The Windows CE Registry

The registry should contain the following entry in

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ceBCPL

Name: BCPLPATH       Data: "\BCPL\cintcode"


You may also find it convenient to update the registry so that double
clicking on .b (bcpl) files automatically invokes the pocket word 
editor. Ie, in:

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/.b

Name: (default)      Data: "bcplfile"

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\bcplfile\Shell\Open\Command

Name: (default)      Data:  "pword %1%
