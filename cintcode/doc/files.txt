The Cintcode BCPL System

This README file lives in the home directory of the BCPL 
cintcode system (often with a name like ---/BCPL/cintcode).

The most important files in this directory are:

README          This README file.

Makefile        To recompile the C and assembly language
                components of the system, link them and
                then enter the system. This version is
                initially for Linux. Makefiles for other
                architectures can be constructed by means
                of minor edits to this file.

bin/cintsys     The compiled form of the 32-bit Cintcode system.

bin/cintsys64   The compiled form of the 64-bit Cintcode system.

bin/wincintsys.exe
                The compiled form of the 32-bit Cintcode system
                for Windows systems.

bin/wincintsys64.exe
                The compiled form of the 64-bit Cintcode system
                for Windows systems.

bin/rasterp     A version of the the system capable of
                generating a postscript version of a time
                memory address diagram of the execution of
                a program. It creates the file RASTER.ps.

bin/winrastsys.exe
                The compiled form of the rastsys for Windows systems.

cin/syscin/     Contains blib, boot, cli, dlib and syslib which are
                Cintcode modules loaded during system 
                initialisation. syslib is a hand written library
                containing the functions sys, muldiv and changeco.

g/              This directory holds BCPL header files read by the GET
                directive. The standard header file is libhdr.h and the
                other headers are:

                bcplfecg.h, mc.h, playmus.h, sial.h and sound.h

bc, bs          Command command files for compilation of
                BCPL programs in ../cintcode/com and 
                ../cintcode/sys.
                Typical usage:  c bc echo
                                c bs BLIB

b               A command command file for compilation of
                user BCPL programs. Typical usage: 

                     cd ../bcplprogs/demos
                     cinterp
                     c b queens
                     queens

bcl, bsl        Command commands for compilation of modules
                for little-ender machines.

bcb, bslb        Command commands for compilation of modules
                for big-ender machines.

enderbig and enderlit
                These are directies containing Cintcode compilations
                of the vital parts of the system for
                big and little ender machines.

compall         A command command to recompile all the BCPL
                files constituting the 32-bit cintcode system.
                It is invoked by: c compall

compall64       A command command to recompile all the BCPL
                files constituting the 64-bit cintcode system.
                It is invoked by: c compall64

doc             A directory containing documentation files,
                such as doc/README, doc/notes and doc/changes.

sysc/cintsys.h  Header file containing system/architecture
                dependent #defines.

sysc/cintsys.c, sys/cinterp.c, sys/kblib.c and sys/nullrastlib.c
                The C components of the system.

sysasm/LINUX/cintasm.s   An assembly language program equivalent to
                sys/cinterp.c.

sysc/rastsys.c sys/rastlib.c
                Modules used by the raster generating version of
                the system.

sysb/           This directory holds the BCPL source of the resident
                part of the system. The files are:
                blib.b, boot.b, cli.b and dlib.b.

sysasm/
                This contains the directories ALPHA, MIPS, SUN4,
                SPARC, MSDOS, MAC, OS2, ARM, BC4, CYGWIN32,
                Win32 and shWinCE. These containing architecture
                dependent files and (with luck) corresponding
                README files.

../bcplprogs    A directory containing directories of 
                demonstration BCPL programs.
