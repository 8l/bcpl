EMACS


My prefered text editor under both Linux and Windows is Emacs. An
emacs package called bcpl.el is available to provide support for BCPL
program development. Its main advantage is that it colours BCPL code
appropriately.

This directory contains the files bcpl.el and _emacs.

Under Linux these should be copied to Elisp/bcpl.el and .emacs in the
user's home directory where they will be automatically read when emacs
starts up.

Under Windows I put the executable for emacs in C:\Emacs and copied
bcpl.el and _emacs into C:\Emacs\Elisp\bcpl.el and C:\Emacs\_emacs.
The file title near the end of _emacs will need to be edited to
reflect the location of bcpl.el. When emacs starts up these files will
be automatically processed.

The implementation of bcpl.el is neither elegant nor quite right but it
is certainly better than nothing.
