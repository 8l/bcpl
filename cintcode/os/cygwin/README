To install and run Cintcode BCPL under Cygwin, first install
Cygwin typically in C:\cygwin.

Extract the BCPL system (either bcpl.zip or bcpl.tgz available
from www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr) to create, say,

C:\cygwin\home\mr10\distribution\BCPL

Copy cintcode\os\cygwin\cygwin.bat into C:\cygwin and edit it if necessary.

Create a desktop shortcut with target: C:\cygwin\cygwin.bat

Double-click on the shortcut

Type:

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode

Edit the file MakefileCygwin, if necessary, then type:

make -f MakefileCygwin clean
make -f MakefileCygwin

This should rebuild Cintcode BCPL and enter it, leaving a prompt similar to:


BCPL Cintcode System (14 Jan 2012)
0.000> 

Test the system by typing:

echo hello
bcpl com/bcpl.b to junk
junk com/bcpl.b to junk
c compall
bench100

If this fails the most common fault is in the setting of
environment variables in cygwin.bat or the location of the
BCPL directories.

To diagnose the problem double-click on the Cygwin shortcut
and type the following:

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode
cintsys -f

This traces the use of the environment variables when opening files.

cintsys -f -v

gives a more detailed trace.

Good luck!
