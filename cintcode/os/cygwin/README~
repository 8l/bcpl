To install and run Cintcode BCPL under Cygwin, first install
Cygwin typically in C:\cycwin. I am currently using Cygwin 1.7 which
is a significant upgrade from Cygwin 1.5.

Extract the BCPL system (either bcpl.zip or bcpl.tgz available
from www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr) into, say,

C:\cygwin\home\mr10\distribution\BCPL

Copy cintcode\os\cygwin\cygwin.bat into C:\cygwin and edit it if necessary.

Create a desktop shortcut with target: C:\cygwin\cygwin.bat

Double-click on the shortcut

Type:

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode
cp os/cygwin/MakefileCygwin Makefile
make clean
make

This should rebuild Cintcode BCPL and enter it.

test the system by typing

echo hello
bcpl com/bcpl.b to junk
junk com/bcpl.b to junk
c compall
bench100

If this fails the most common fault is in the setting of
environment variables in cygwin.bat or the location of the
BCPL directories.

To diagnose the problem double-click on the Cygwin shortcut
and type the following:

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode
cintsys -f

This traces which files are being loaded.

cintsys -f -v

gives a more detailed trace.

Good luck!
