Install and run Cintcode BCPL under Windows using Visual C.

If you do not have have Visual C installed see the end of this
document.

Extract the BCPL system (either bcpl.zip or bcpl.tgz available
from www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr) into, say,

E:\distribution\BCPL

Create a desktop shortcut with something like: 

Target: %SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe /q /k os/windows/VC8env.bat
Start in:  E:\distribution\BCPL\cintcode

Double-click on the shortcut

Type:

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode
nmake /f MakefileVC clean
nmake /f MakefileVC

This should rebuild Cintcode BCPL and enter it.

Test the system by typing

echo hello
bcpl com/bcpl.b to junk
junk com/bcpl.b to junk
c compall
bench100

If this fails the most common fault is in the setting of environment
variables in, say, os\windows\VC9env.bat or the location of the BCPL
directories.

To diagnose the problem double-click on the shortcut
and type the following:

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode
cintsys -f

This traces which files are being loaded.

cintsys -f -v

gives a more detailed trace.

If you wish to use the BCPL interface with the SDL graphics library,
install SDL putting it in a directory such as E:\SDL then type
something like

cd distribution/BCPL/cintcode
nmake /f MakefileVCSDL clean
nmake /f MakefileVCSDL

possibly modifying MakefileVCSDL first. If this works you should be
able to compile and run all the programs in bcplprogs\raspi as
described in bcpl4raspi (available via my home page).


Good luck!

PS

If you do not have have Visual C installed a precompiled version of
cintsys.exe and rastsys.exe is in os/windows/wincintsys.exe and
os/windows/wincintsys.exe, or possibly os/windows/wincintsyssdl.exe
and os/windows/wincintsyssdl.exe.

Edit eg VCenv.bat to remove all references to Visual C but leave the
commands setting up the BCPL environment variables. Type:

copy os/windows/wincintsys.exe cintsys.exe
cintsys

This should work.
